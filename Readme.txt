you can convert char to String in two way and Ways are defined by method1 and mothod2


1) for Scanner class you need to import,
  import java.util.Scanner;

2)
for other like function I include,
import java.lang.*;

3)
here in method1 and method2 I have mentioned
getClass().getSimpleName();
this will give you type of variable
i include this because to see is it realy converted or not.
